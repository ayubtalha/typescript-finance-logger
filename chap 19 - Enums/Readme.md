# Things to do

1. Change these in tsconfig.json

- "target": "ES6"
- 'ES5', 'ES2015'

2. Add the type in index.html

- like this <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>

3. Use the `export` and `import` method

# Drawbacks

- Only recongnized by Modern Browesers
- Complies into multiple files not into single file. Have a look at the public/classes/Invoice.js. Because of this it will be giving multiple requests.
